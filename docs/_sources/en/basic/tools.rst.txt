Variable saving and restore: ``tf.train.Checkpoint``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/checkpoints

.. admonition:: Warning
    
    Checkpoint only saves the parameters (variables) of the model, not the calculation process of the model, so it is generally used to recover previously trained model parameters when the model source code is available. If you need to export the model (and run it without source code), please refer to :ref:`SavedModel <en_savedmodel>` in the "Deployment" section.

In many scenarios, we want to save the trained parameters (variables) after the model training is complete. By loading models and parameters elsewhere where they need to be used, you can get trained models directly. Probably the first thing that comes to mind is to use ``pickle`` in Python to serialize ``model.variables``. Unfortunately, TensorFlow's variable type ``ResourceVariable`` cannot be serialized.

The good thing is that, TensorFlow provides a powerful variable save and restore class, ``tf.train.Checkpoint``, which can save and restore all objects in TensorFlow that contain Checkpointable State using its ``save()`` and ``restore()`` methods. Specifically, TensorFlow instances including ``tf.keras.optimizer``, ``tf.Variable``, ``tf.keras.Layer`` and ``tf.keras.Model`` can be saved. 

Checkpoint is very easy to use, we start by declaring a Checkpoint.

.. code-block:: python

    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)

Here the ``tf.train.Checkpoint()`` accepts a special initialization parameter, a ``**kwargs``. It is a series of key-value pairs. The key names can be taken by your own, and the values are the objects to be saved. For example, if we want to save an instance of ``model`` inheriting ``tf.keras.Model`` and an optimizer ``optimizer`` inheriting ``tf.train.Optimizer``, we could write

.. code-block:: python

    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(myAwesomeModel=model, myAwesomeOptimizer=optimizer)

Here ``myAwesomeModel`` is an arbitrary key name we take for the ``model`` instance that we want to save. Note that we will also use this key name when recovering variables.

Next, when the model training is complete and needs to be saved, use

.. code-block:: python

    checkpoint.save(save_path_with_prefix)

and things are all set. ``save_path_with_prefix`` is the save directory with prefix.

.. admonition:: Note

    For example, by creating a folder named "save" in the source directory and calling ``checkpoint.save('./save/model.ckpt')``, we can find three files named ``checkpoint``, ``model.ckpt-1.index``, ``model.ckpt-1.data-00000-of-00001`` in the save directory, and these files record variable information. The ``checkpoint.save()`` method can be run several times, and each run will result in a ``.index`` file and a ``.data`` file, with serial numbers added in sequence.

When the variable values of a previously saved instance needs to be reloaded elsewhere, a checkpoint needs to be instantiated again, while keeping the key names consistent. Then call the checkpoint's restore method like this

.. code-block:: python

    model_to_be_restored = MyModel()                                        # the same class of model that need to be restored
    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(myAwesomeModel=model_to_be_restored)   # keep the key name to be "myAwesomeModel"
    checkpoint.restore(save_path_with_prefix_and_index)

The model variables can then be recovered. ``save_path_with_prefix_and_index`` is the directory + prefix + number of the previously saved file. For example, calling ``checkpoint.store('./save/model.ckpt-1')`` will load a file with the prefix ``model.ckpt`` and a serial number of 1.

When multiple files are saved, we often want to load the most recent one. You can use ``tf.train.latest_checkpoint(save_path)`` to get the file name of the last checkpoint in the directory. For example, if there are 10 saved files in the save directory from ``model.ckpt-1.index`` to ``model.ckpt-10.index``, ``tf.train.most_checkpoint('./save')`` will return ``./save/model.ckpt-10``.

In general, a typical code framework for saving and restoring variables is as follows

.. code-block:: python

    # train.py: model training stage

    model = MyModel()
    # Instantiate the Checkpoint, specify the model instance to be saved 
    # (you can also add the optimizer if you want to save it)
    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(myModel=model)     
    # ... (model training code)
    # Save the variable values to a file when the training is finished 
    # (you can also save them regularly during the training)
    checkpoint.save('./save/model.ckpt')               

.. code-block:: python

    # test.py: model inference stage

    model = MyModel()
    # Instantiate the Checkpoint and specify the instance to be recovered.
    checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(myModel=model)            
    # recover the variable values of the model instance 
    checkpoint.restore(tf.train.latest_checkpoint('./save'))   
    # ... (model inference code)

.. admonition:: Note

    ``tf.train.Checkpoint`` is stronger than the ``tf.train.Saver`` commonly used in TensorFlow 1.X, in that it supports "delayed" recovery of variables in eager execution mode. Specifically, when ``checkpoint.store()`` is called, but the variable in the model has not been created, Checkpoint can wait until the variable is created to recover the value. In eager execution mode, the initialization of the layers in the model and the creation of variables is done when the model is first called (the advantage is that the variable shape can be determined automatically based on the input tensor shape, without having to be specified manually). This means that when the model has just been instantiated, there is not even a single variable in it, and it is bound to raise error to recover the variable values if we keep the same way as before. For example, you can try calling the ``save_weight()`` method of ``tf.keras.Model`` in ``train.py`` to save the parameters of the model, and call the ``load_weight()`` method immediately after instantiating the model in ``test.py``. You will get an error. Only if you call the model once can you recover the variable values via ``load_weight()``. If you use ``tf.train.Checkpoint``, you do not need to worry about this. In addition, ``tf.train.Checkpoint`` also supports graph execution mode.

Finally, we provide an example of saving and restore of model variables, based on the :ref:`multi-layer perceptron <en_mlp>` in the previous chapter

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/save_and_restore/mnist.py
    :emphasize-lines: 20, 30-32, 38-39

After creating the ``save`` folder in the code directory and running the training code, the ``save`` folder will hold model variable data that is saved every 100 batches. Adding ``--mode=test`` to the command line argument and running the code again, the model will be restored using the last saved variable values. Then we can directly obtain an accuracy rate of about 95% on test set.

.. admonition:: Use ``tf.train.CheckpointManager`` to delete old Checkpoints and customize file numbers

    During the training of the model, sometimes we'll have the following needs

    - After a long training period, the program will save a large number of Checkpoints, but we only want to keep the last few Checkpoints.
    - Checkpoint is numbered by default from 1, accruing 1 at a time, but we may want to use another numbering method (e.g. using the current number of batch as the file number).

    We can use TensorFlow's ``tf.train.CheckpointManager`` to satisfy these needs. After instantiating a Checkpoint, we instantiate a CheckpointManager

    .. code-block:: python

        checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=model)
        manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, directory='./save', checkpoint_name='model.ckpt', max_to_keep=k)

    Here, the ``directory`` parameter is the path to the saved file, ``checkpoint_name`` is the file name prefix (or ``ckpt`` by default if not provided), and ``max_to_keep`` is the number of retained checkpoints.

    When we need to save the model, we can use ``manager.save()`` directly. If we wish to assign our own number to the saved Checkpoint, we can add the ``checkpoint_number`` parameter to ``manager.save()`` like ``manager.save(checkpoint_number=100)``.

    The following code provides an example of using CheckpointManager to keep only the last three Checkpoint files and to use the number of the batch as the file number for the Checkpoint.

Visualization of training process: TensorBoard
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r2/get_started

Sometimes you may want to see how indicators change during model training (e.g. the loss value). Although it can be viewed via command line output, it seems not intuitive enough. And TensorBoard is a tool that can help us visualize the training process.

Real-time monitoring of indicator change
-------------------------------------------

To use TensorBoard, first create a folder (e.g. ``./tensorboard``) in the code directory to hold the TensorBoard log files, then instantiate a logger as follows

.. code-block:: python
    
    summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./tensorboard')     # the parameter is the log folder we created

Next, when it is necessary to record the indicators during training, the value of the indicators during training at STEP can be logged by specifying the logger with the WITH statement and running ``tf.summary.scalar(name, tensor, step=batch_index)`` for the indicator (usually scalar) to be logged. The STEP parameters here can be set according to your own needs and can generally be set to the index of batch in the current training process. The overall framework is as follows.

.. code-block:: python

    summary_writer = tf.summary.create_file_writer('./tensorboard')    
    # start model training
    for batch_index in range(num_batches):
        # ... (training code, use variable "loss" to store current loss value)
        with summary_writer.as_default():                               # the logger to be used
            tf.summary.scalar("loss", loss, step=batch_index)
            tf.summary.scalar("MyScalar", my_scalar, step=batch_index)  # you can also add other indicators below

For every run of ``tf.summary.scalar()``, the logger writes a log to the log file. In addition to the simplest scalar (scalar), TensorBoard can also visualize other types of data like image and audio, as detailed in the `TensorBoard documentation <https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r2/get_started>`_.

When we want to visualize the training process, open the terminal in the code directory (and go to TensorFlow's conda environment if needed) and run::

    tensorboard --logdir=./tensorboard

The visual interface of the TensorBoard can then be accessed by using a browser to access the URL output from the command line program (usually http://name-of-your-computer:6006), as shown in the following figure.

.. figure:: /_static/image/tools/tensorboard.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

By default, TensorBoard updates data every 30 seconds. But you can also refresh manually by clicking the refresh button in the top right corner.

The following caveats apply to the use of TensorBoard.

* If retraining is required, the information in the logging folder needs to be deleted and TensorBoard need to be restarted (or you can create a new logging folder and start another TensorBoard process, with the ``-logdir`` parameter set to the newly created folder).
* Log folder path should not contain any special characters.

.. _en_graph_profile:

Visualize Graph and Profile Information
-------------------------------------------

We can also use ``tf.summary.trace_on`` to open Trace during training, where TensorFlow records a lot of information during training, such as the structure of the dataflow graph, and the time spent on each operation. When training is complete, you can use ``tf.summary.trace_export`` to export the recorded results to a file.

.. code-block:: python

    tf.summary.trace_on(graph=True, profiler=True)  # Open Trace option, then the dataflow graph and profiling information can be recorded
    # ... (training code)
    with summary_writer.as_default():
        tf.summary.trace_export(name="model_trace", step=0, profiler_outdir=log_dir)    # Save Trace information to a file

After that, we can select "Profile" in TensorBoard to see the time spent on each operation in a timeline. If you have created a dataflow graph using :ref:`tf.function <tffunction>`, you can also click "Graph" to view the graph structure.

.. _en_tfdata:

Dataset construction and preprocessing: ``tf.data`` 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/data

In many scenarios, we want to use our own datasets to train the model. However, the process of preprocessing and reading raw data files is often cumbersome and even more labor-intensive than the design of the model. For example, in order to read a batch of image files, we may need to struggle with python's various image processing packages (such as ``pillow``), design our own batch generation method, and finally may not run as efficiently as expected. To this end, TensorFlow provides the ``tf.data`` module, which includes a flexible set of dataset building APIs that help us quickly and efficiently build data input pipelines, especially for large-scale scenarios.

Dataset construction
-------------------------------------------

At the heart of ``tf.data`` is the ``tf.data.Dataset`` class, which provides a high-level encapsulation of the TensorFlow dataset. ``tf.data.Dataset`` consists of a series of iteratively accessible elements, each containing one or more tensor. For example, for a dataset consisting of images, each element can be an image tensor with the shape ``width x height x number of channels``, or a tuple consisting of an image tensor and an image label tensor.

The most basic way to build ``tf.data.Dataset`` is to use ``tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()`` for small amount of data (which can fit into the memory). Specifically, if all the elements of our dataset are stacked together into a large tensor through the 0-th dimension of the tensor (e.g., the training set of the MNIST dataset in the previous section is one large tensor with shape ``[60000, 28, 28, 1]``, representing 60,000 single-channel grayscale image of size 28*28), then we provide such one or more large tensor as input, and can construct the dataset by unstack it on the 0-th dimension of the tensor. In this case, the size of the 0-th dimension is the number of data elements in the dataset. We have an example as follows

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tfdata/tutorial.py
    :lines: 1-14
    :emphasize-lines: 11

Output::

    2013 12000
    2014 14000
    2015 15000
    2016 16500
    2017 17500

.. admonition:: Warning

    When multiple tensors are provided as input, the size of 0-th dimension of these tensors must be the same, and the multiple tensors must be spliced as tuples (i.e., using parentheses in Python).

Similarly, we can load the MNIST dataset in the previous chapter.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tfdata/tutorial.py
    :lines: 16-25
    :emphasize-lines: 5

Output

.. figure:: /_static/image/tools/mnist_1.png
    :width: 40%
    :align: center

.. admonition:: Hint

    TensorFlow Datasets provides an out-of-the-box collection of datasets based on ``tf.data.Datasets``. You can view :doc:`TensorFlow Datasets <../appendix/tfds>` for the detailed usage. For example, we can load the MNIST dataset in just two lines of code:

    .. code-block:: python

        import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
        dataset = tfds.load("mnist", split=tfds.Split.TRAIN, as_supervised=True)

For extremely large datasets that cannot be fully loaded into the memory, we can first process the datasets in TFRecord format and then use ``tf.data.TFRocrdDataset()`` to load them. You can refer to :ref:`the TFRecord section <tfrecord>` for details.

Dataset preprocessing
-------------------------------------------

The ``tf.data.Dataset`` class provides us with a variety of dataset preprocessing methods. Some of the most commonly used methods are

- ``Dataset.map(f)``: apply the function ``f`` to each element of the dataset to obtain a new dataset (this part is often combined with ``tf.io`` to read, write and decode files and ``tf.image`` to process images).
- ``Dataset.shuffle(buffer_size)``: shuffle the dataset (set a fixed-size buffer, put the first ``buffer_size`` element in the buffer, and sample randomly from the buffer, replacing the sampled data with subsequent data).
- ``Dataset.batch(batch_size)``: batches the dataset, i.e. for each ``batch_size`` elements, using ``tf.stack()` to merge into one element on dimension 0.

In addition, there are ``Dataset.repeat()`` (repeat elements in the dataset), ``Dataset.reduce()`` (aggregation operation), ``Dataset.take()`` (interception of the first few elements of a dataset), etc. Further description can be found in the `API document <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset>`_.

The following example is based on the MNIST data set.

    The second run

It can be seen that each time the data is randomly shuffled.

.. admonition:: ``buffer_size`` setting of ``Dataset.shuffle()``

    As an iterator designed for large-scale data, ``tf.data.Dataset`` does not support easy access to the number of its own elements or random access to elements. Therefore, in order to shuffle the data set efficiently, some specific designed methods are needed. ``Dataset.shuffle()`` took the following approach.

    - Set a buffer with fixed size ``buffer_size``.
    - At initialization, the first ``buffer_size`` element of the dataset is moved to the buffer.
    - Each time an element needs to be randomly taken from the dataset, then one element is randomly sampled and taken out from the buffer (so there is an empty space in the buffer), and then one subsequent element in the dataset is taken out and put back into the empty space to maintain the size of the buffer.

    Therefore, the size of the buffer needs to be set reasonably according to the characteristics of the dataset. For example.

    - When ``buffer_size`` is set to 1, it is equivalent to no shuffling at all.
    - When the label order of the dataset is extremely unevenly distributed (e.g., the first half labels of the dataset are 0 and the second half labels are 1 in binary classification), a small buffer size will result in all elements in a batch to have same label, thus affecting the training effect. In general, the size of the buffer can be smaller if the distribution of the dataset is more random, otherwise a larger buffer is required.

.. _en_prefetch:

Increase the efficiency using the parallelization strategy of ``tf.data``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance

When training models, we want to make the most of computing resources and reduce CPU/GPU idle time. However, sometimes, the preparation of dataset is very time-consuming, thus we have to spend a lot of time preparing data for training before each batch of training. When we are preparing the data, the GPU can only wait for data with no load, resulting in a waste of computing resources, as shown in the following figure.

.. figure:: /_static/image/tools/datasets_without_pipelining.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

    Original training process, GPU can only be idle when preparing data. `Source 1 <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance>`_ 。

To tackle this problem, ``tf.data`` provides us with the ``Dataset.prefetch()`` method, which allows us to let the dataset prefetch several elements during training, so that the CPU can prepare data while training in the GPU, improving the efficiency of the training process, as shown below.

.. figure:: /_static/image/tools/datasets_with_pipelining.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center
    
     The training process with ``Dataset.prefetch()``. The CPU preloads the data while the GPU is training the model, improving training efficiency. `Source 2 <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance>`_ 。

The usage of ``Dataset.prefetch()`` is very similar to ``Dataset.batch()`` and ``Dataset.shuffle()`` in the previous section. Continuing with the MNIST dataset example, if you want to preloaded data, you can use the following code

.. code-block:: python

    mnist_dataset = mnist_dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)

Here the parameter ``buffer_size`` can be set either manually, or set to ``tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE`` to let TensorFlow select the appropriate value automatically.

Similarly, ``Dataset.map()`` can also transform data elements in parallel with multiple GPU resources to increase efficiency. Take the MNIST dataset as an example. assumes that the training machine has a 2-core CPU, and we want to take full advantage of the multi-core CPU to perform a parallelized transformation of the data (e.g. the 90-degree rotation function ``rot90`` in the previous section), we can using the following code

.. code-block:: python

    mnist_dataset = mnist_dataset.map(map_func=rot90, num_parallel_calls=2)

The operation process is shown in the following figure.

.. figure:: /_static/image/tools/datasets_parallel_map.png
    :width: 100%
    :align: center

    Parallelization of data conversion is achieved by setting the ``num_parallel_calls`` parameter of ``Dataset.map()``. The top part is unparallelized and the bottom part is 2-core parallel. `Source 3 <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance>`_ 。

It is also possible to set ``num_parallel_calls`` to ``tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE`` to allow TensorFlow to automatically select the appropriate value.

In addition to this, there are a number of ways to improve dataset processing performance, which can be found in the `TensorFlow documentation <https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance>`_. The powerful performance of the tf.data parallelization policy is demonstrated in a later example, which can be viewed :ref:`here <en_tfdata_performance>`.

Fetching elements from datasets
-------------------------------------------
After the data is constructed and pre-processed, we need to iterate through it to get the data for training. ``tf.data.Dataset`` is an iteratable Python object, so data can be obtained using the For loop iteratively, namely.

.. code-block:: python

    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((A, B, C, ...))
    for a, b, c, ... in dataset:
        # Operate on tensor a, b, c, etc., e.g. feed into model for training

You can also use ``iter()` to explicitly create a Python iterator and use ``next()` to get the next element, namely.

.. code-block:: python

    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((A, B, C, ...))
    it = iter(dataset)
    a_0, b_0, c_0, ... = next(it)
    a_1, b_1, c_1, ... = next(it)

Keras supports the use of ``tf.data.Dataset`` directly as input. When calling the ``fit()`` and ``evaluate()`` methods of ``tf.keras.Model``, the input data ``x`` in the parameter can be specified as ``Dataset`` with all elements formatted as ``(input data, label data) ``. In this case, the parameter ``y`` (label data) can be ignored. For example, for the MNIST dataset mentioned above, the original Keras training approach is.

.. code-block:: python

    model.fit(x=train_data, y=train_label, epochs=num_epochs, batch_size=batch_size)

After using ``tf.data.Dataset``, we can pass the dataset directly into Keras API.

.. code-block:: python

    model.fit(mnist_dataset, epochs=num_epochs)

Since the dataset have already been divided into batches by the ``Dataset.batch()`` method, we do not need to provide the size of the batch to ``model.fit()``.

.. _en_cats_vs_dogs:

Example: cats_vs_dogs image classification
-------------------------------------------

The following code, using the "Cat and Dog" binary image classification task as an example, demonstrates the complete process of building, training and testing model with ``tf.data`` combined with ``tf.io`` and ``tf.image``. The dataset can be downloaded `here <https://www.floydhub.com/fastai/datasets/cats-vs-dogs>`_. The dataset should be decompressed into the ``data_dir`` directory in the code (here the default setting is ``C:/datasets/cats_vs_dogs``, which can be modified to suit your needs).

By performing performance tests on the above examples, we can feel the powerful parallelization performance of ``tf.data``.

The test results are as follows.

.. _en_tfrecord:

TFRecord: Dataset format of TensorFlow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord

TFRecord is the dataset storage format in TensorFlow. Once we have organized the datasets into TFRecord format, TensorFlow can read and process them efficiently, helping us to train large-scale models more efficiently.

TFRecord can be understood as a file consisting of a series of serialized ``tf.train.Sample`` elements, each ``tf.train.Sample`` consisting of a dict of several ``tf.train.Feature``. The form is as follows.

::

    # dataset.tfrecords
    [
        {   # example 1 (tf.train.Example)
            'feature_1': tf.train.Feature,
            ...
            'feature_k': tf.train.Feature
        },
        ...
        {   # example N (tf.train.Example)
            'feature_1': tf.train.Feature,
            ...
            'feature_k': tf.train.Feature
        }
    ]


In order to organize the various datasets into TFRecord format, we can do the following steps for each element of the dataset.

- Read the data element into memory.
- Convert the element to `tf.train.example` objects (each `tf.train.example` consists of several ``tf.train.Feature``, so a dictionary of Feature needs to be created first).
- Serialize the ``tf.train.Sample``` object as a string and write it to a TFRecord file with a predefined ``tf.io.TFRecordWriter``.

To read the TFRecord data, follow these steps.

- Obtain a ``tf.data.Dataset`` instance by reading the original TFRecord file (notice that the ``tf.train.Sample`` object in the file has not been deserialized).
- Deserialize the ``tf.train.Sample`` string by ``tf.io.parse_single_example`` function for each serialized ``tf.train.Sample`` string in the dataset through the ``Dataset.map`` method.

In the following part, we show a code example to convert the training set of the :ref:`cats_vs_dogs dataset  <en_cats_vs_dogs>` into a TFRecord file and load this file.

Convert the dataset into a TFRecord file
-------------------------------------------

First, similar to the :ref:`previous section <en_cats_vs_dogs>`, we `download the dataset <https://www.floydhub.com/fastai/datasets/cats-vs-dogs>`_ and extract it to ``data_dir``. We also initialize the list of image filenames and tags for the dataset.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tfrecord/cats_vs_dogs.py
    :lines: 1-12

Then, through the following code, we iteratively read each image, build the ``tf.train.Feature`` dictionary and the ``tf.train.Sample`` object, serialize it and write it to the TFRecord file.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tfrecord/cats_vs_dogs.py
    :lines: 14-22

It is worth noting that ``tf.train.Feature`` supports three data formats.

- ``tf.train.BytesList``: string or binary files (e.g. image). Use ``bytes_list`` parameter to pass through a ``tf.train.BytesList`` object initialized by an array of strings or bytes.
- ``tf.train.FloatList`` : float or double numbers. Use ``float_list`` parameter to pass through a ``tf.train.FloatList`` object initialized by a float or double array.
- ``tf.train.Int64List`` : integers. Use ``int64_list`` parameter to pass through a ``tf.train.Int64List`` object initialized by an array of integers.

If you want to feed in only one element rather than an array, you can pass in an array with only one element.

With the code above, we can get a file sized around 500MB named ``train.tfrecords``.

Read the TFRecord file
-------------------------------------------

We can read the file ``train.tfrecords`` created in the previous section, and decode each serialized ``tf.train.Example`` object with ``Dataset.map`` and ``tf.io.parse_single_example`` .

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tfrecord/cats_vs_dogs.py
    :lines: 24-36

The ``feature_description`` is like a "description file" of a dataset, informing the ``tf.io.parse_single_example`` function the properties of each ``tf.train.sample`` element, through a dictionary of key-value pairs. The properties contain which features are available for each ``tf.train.sample`` element, and the type, shape, and other properties of those features. The three input parameters of ``tf.io.FixedLenFeatures``: ``shape``, ``dtype`` and ``default_value`` (optional) are the shape, type and default values for each Feature. Here our data items are single values or strings, so ``shape``` is an empty array.

After running the above code, we get a dataset instance ``dataset``, which is already a ``tf.data.Dataset`` instance that can be used for training! We output an element from this dataset to validate the code

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tfrecord/cats_vs_dogs.py
    :lines: 38-43

Output:

.. figure:: /_static/image/tools/tfrecord_cat.png
    :width: 60%
    :align: center

It can be seen that the images and labels are displayed correctly, and the data set is constructed successfully.

Graph execution mode: ``@tf.function`` *
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the default Eager Execution mode gives us flexibility and ease of debugging, in some scenarios, we still want to use the Graph Execution mode (default in in TensorFlow 1.X) to transform the model into an efficient TensorFlow graph model, especially when we want high performance or to deploy models. Therefore, TensorFlow 2 provides us with the ``tf.function`` module, which, in conjunction with the AutoGraph mechanism, makes it easy to run the model in graph execution mode by simply adding a ``@tf.function``` decorator.

Basic usage of ``tf.function``
-------------------------------------------

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/autograph
    https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/autograph
    https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/eager/tf_function
    https://pgaleone.eu/tensorflow/tf.function/2019/03/21/dissecting-tf-function-part-1/
    https://pgaleone.eu/tensorflow/tf.function/2019/04/03/dissecting-tf-function-part-2/
    https://pgaleone.eu/tensorflow/tf.function/2019/05/10/dissecting-tf-function-part-3/

In TensorFlow 2, it is recommended to use ``tf.function`` (instead of ``tf.Session`` in 1.X) to implement the graph execution, so that you can convert the model to an easy-to-deploy, high-performance TensorFlow graph model. To use tf.function, you can just simply encapsulate the code within a function, and decorate the function with ``@tf.function`` decorator, as shown in the example below. For an in-depth discussion of the graph execution mode, see :doc:`the appendix <../advanced/static>` .

.. admonition:: Warning

    Not all functions can be decorated by ``@tf.function``! ``@tf.function`` uses static compilation to convert the code within the function into a dataflow graph, so there are restrictions on the statements that can be used within the function (only a subset of the Python language is supported), and the operations within the function need to be able to act as a node in the computational graph. It is recommended to use only native TensorFlow operations within the function, not to use overly complex Python statements, and only include TensorFlow tensors or NumPy arrays in the function arguments. In conclusion, it will be better to build the function according to the idea of a dataflow graph. ``@tf.function`` just gives you a more convenient way to write computational graphs, not a `"silver bullet" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet>`_ that will accelerate any function. Details are available at `AutoGraph Capabilities and Limitations <https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/autograph/g3doc/reference/limitations.md>`_. You can read this section together with :doc:`the appendix <../advanced/static>` for better understanding. 

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/model/autograph/main.py
    :emphasize-lines: 11, 18

With 400 batches, the program took 35.5 seconds with ``@tf.function`` and 43.8 seconds without ``@tf.function''. It can be seen that ``@tf.function`` brought some performance improvements. In general, ``@tf.function`` brings greater performance boost when the model is composed of many small operations. But if the model does not have much operations while each operation is time-consuming, the performance gains from ``@tf.function`` will not be significant.

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/autograph
    Functions can be faster than eager code, for graphs with many small ops. But for graphs with a few expensive ops (like convolutions), you may not see much speedup.

Internal mechanism of ``tf.function``
-------------------------------------------

When the function decorated by ``@tf.function`` is called for the first time, the following is done.

- In an environment where the eager execution mode is off, the code within the function runs sequentially. That is, each TensorFlow operation API simply defines the computation node (OpNode) in a dataflow graph, and does not perform any substantive computation. This is consistent with the graph execution mode of TensorFlow 1.X.
- Use AutoGraph to convert Python control flow statements to corresponding computation nodes in the TensorFlow datagraph graph (e.g. ``while`` and ``for`` statements to ``tf.while``, ``if`` statements to ``tf.cond``).
- Based on the above two steps, create a dataflow graph representation of the code within the function (the graph will also automatically include some ``tf.control_dependencies`` nodes in order to ensure the computational order of the graph).
- Run this calculation once.
- Cache the built dataflow graph to a hash table. The hash key based on the name of the function and the type of function argument

When a function is called again after being decorated by ``@tf.function``, TensorFlow will first calculate the hash key based on the function name and the type of function argument. If the corresponding dataflow graph is already in the hash table, then use the cached dataflow graph directly, otherwise recreate the dataflow graph by following the steps above.

.. admonition:: Hint

    For developers familiar with TensorFlow 1.X who want to obtain the dataflow graphs generated by ``tf.function`` directly for further processing and debugging, you can use the ``get_concrete_function``` method of the decorated function. The method accepts the same arguments as the decorated function. For example, in order to obtain the graph generated by the function ``train_one_step`` modified by ``@tf.function`` in the previous section, the following code can be used.

    .. code-block:: python

        graph = train_one_step.get_concrete_function(X, y)

    in which the ``graph`` is an ``tf.Graph`` object.

The following is a quiz:

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/model/autograph/quiz.py
    :lines: 1-18

What is the result of this procedure above?

Answer::

    The function is running in Python
    1
    2
    2
    The function is running in Python
    0.1
    0.2    

When calculating ``f(a)``, TensorFlow does the following, since it is the first time this function is called.

- The code within the function is run through in turn (hence it output the text "The function is running in Python").
- A dataflow graph was constructed, and then that graph was run once (thus outputting number "1"). Here ``tf.print(x)`` can be used as a node of the dataflow graph, but Python's built-in ``print`` cannot be converted to a node of the dataflow graph. Therefore, only the operation ``tf.print(x)`` is included in the calculation graph.
- The graph is cached in a hash table (the constructed graph is reused if it is followed by a tensor input of type ``tf.int32`` with an empty shape).

When calculating ``f(b)``, since b has the same type as a, TensorFlow reuses the previously constructed dataflow graph and runs (thus outputting number "2"). Here the text output code on the first line of the function is not run because the code in the function is not really run line by line. When calculating ``f(b_)``, TensorFlow automatically converts the numpy data structure to a tensor in TensorFlow, so it can still reuse the previously constructed graph.

When calculating ``f(c)``, although the tensor ``c`` has the same shape as ``a``, ``b``, but the type is ``tf.float32`` instead. For this case, TensorFlow re-runs the code in the function (thus outputting the text again) and creates a dataflow graph with input of type ``tf.float32``.

When calculating ``f(d)``, since ``d`` and ``c`` are of the same type, TensorFlow reuse the dataflow graph and similarly does not output text.

The treatment of Python's built-in integer and floating-point types by ``@tf.function`` is shown by the following example.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/model/autograph/quiz.py
    :lines: 18-24

The result is::

    The function is running in Python
    1
    The function is running in Python
    2
    1
    The function is running in Python
    0.1
    The function is running in Python
    0.2
    0.1

In short, for Python's built-in integer and floating-point types, ``@tf.function`` will only reuse a previously created graph when the values are exactly the same, and will not automatically convert Python's built-in integers or floating-point numbers into tensors. Therefore, extra care needs to be taken if you need to contain Python's built-in integers or floating-point numbers in function arguments. In general, Python built-in types should only be used as parameters for functions decorated by ``@tf.function`` on a few occasions, such as specifying hyperparameters.

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/function
    Note that unlike other TensorFlow operations, we don't convert python numerical inputs to tensors. Moreover, a new graph is generated for each distinct python numerical value, for example calling g(2) and g(3) will generate two new graphs (while only one is generated if you call g(tf.constant(2)) and g(tf.constant(3))). Therefore, python numerical inputs should be restricted to arguments that will have few distinct values, such as hyperparameters like the number of layers in a neural network. This allows TensorFlow to optimize each variant of the neural network.

The next quiz:

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/model/autograph/quiz_2.py

The output is::

    tf.Tensor(1.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)
    tf.Tensor(3.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

As in the other examples in this handbook, you can call ``tf.Variable``, ``tf.keras.optimizers``, ``tf.keras.Model`` and other classes containing variables in functions decorated by ``@tf.function``. Once called, these class instances are provided to the function as implicit arguments. When the values within these instance are modified inside the function, the modification is also valid outside the function.

AutoGraph: Converting Python control flows into TensorFlow graphs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned earlier, ``@tf.function`` uses a mechanism called "AutoGraph" to convert the Python control flow statement in the function to the corresponding node in the TensorFlow dataflow graph. Here is an example of using the low-level API of ``tf.autograph``, ``tf.autograph.to_code``, to convert the function ``square_if_positive`` to a TensorFlow dataflow graph.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/model/autograph/autograph.py

Output:

::

    tf.Tensor(1, shape=(), dtype=int32) tf.Tensor(0, shape=(), dtype=int32)
    def tf__square_if_positive(x):
        do_return = False
        retval_ = ag__.UndefinedReturnValue()
        cond = x > 0

        def get_state():
            return ()

        def set_state(_):
            pass

        def if_true():
            x_1, = x,
            x_1 = x_1 * x_1
            return x_1

        def if_false():
            x = 0
            return x
        x = ag__.if_stmt(cond, if_true, if_false, get_state, set_state)
        do_return = True
        retval_ = x
        cond_1 = ag__.is_undefined_return(retval_)

        def get_state_1():
            return ()

        def set_state_1(_):
            pass

        def if_true_1():
            retval_ = None
            return retval_

        def if_false_1():
            return retval_
        retval_ = ag__.if_stmt(cond_1, if_true_1, if_false_1, get_state_1, set_state_1)
        return retval_

We note that the Python control flow in the original function ``if... else...`` are automatically compiled to ``x = ag__.if_stmt(cond, if_true, if_false, get_state, set_state)`` which is based on dataflow graph. AutoGraph serves as a compiler-like function that helps us easily build dataflow graphs with conditions/loops using a more natural Python control flow, without having to build them manually using TensorFlow's API.

Using traditional ``tf.Session``
------------------------------------------- 

It is okay if you still want to use the API in TensorFlow 1.X to build dataflow graph. TensorFlow 2 provides the ``tf.compat.v1`` module to support the TensorFlow 1.X API, and Keras model is compatible with both the eager execution and graph execution modes (with a little care when writing the model). Note that in graph execution mode, ``model(input_tensor)`` only needs to be run once to build the graph.

For example, the MLP or CNN model created in the previous chapter can also be trained on the MNIST dataset with the following code.

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/model/mnist/main.py
    :lines: 112-136


More information about graph execution mode can be found in :doc:`../advanced/static`。

TensorFlow dynamic array: ``tf.TensorArray`` *
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/TensorArray

In some network structures, especially those involving time series, we may need to store a series of tensor sequentially in an array for further processing. In eager execution mode, you can simply use a Python List to store the values directly. However, if you need features based on dataflow graphs (e.g. using ``@tf.function`` to speed up models or using SavedModel to export models), you cannot use this approach. Thus, TensorFlow provides ``tf.TensorArray``, a TensorFlow dynamic array that supports dataflow graph.

To instantiate a ``tf.TensorArray``, use the following code

- ``arr = tf.TensorArray(dtype, size, dynamic_size=False)``: Instantiate a TensorArray ``arr`` of size ``size`` and type ``dtype``. If the ``dynamic_size`` parameter is set to ``True``, the array will automatically grow in space.

To read and write values, use:

- ``write(index, value)`` ：write ``value`` to the ``index``-th position of the array.
- ``read(index)`` : read the ``index``-th value of the array.

In addition, TensorArray includes some useful operations such as ``stack()`` and ``unstack()``. See the `document <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/TensorArray>`_ for details.

Please note that the you should always add left value to ``write()`` method of ``tf.TensorArray``, due to the need to support the dataflow graph. That is, in the graph execution mode, the operation must be in the following form.

.. code-block:: python

    arr = arr.write(index, value)

Only then can a dataflow graph operation be generated and returned to ``arr``. It cannot be written as

.. code-block:: python

    arr.write(index, value)     # the generated operation node is lost since no left variable store it

A simple example is as follows

.. literalinclude:: /_static/code/zh/tools/tensorarray/example.py

Output

::
    
    tf.Tensor(0.0, shape=(), dtype=float32) tf.Tensor(1.0, shape=(), dtype=float32) tf.Tensor(2.0, shape=(), dtype=float32)

Setting and allocating GPUs: ``tf.config`` *
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

..
    https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/using_gpu

Allocate GPUs for current program
------------------------------------------- 

In many scenarios, there are several students or researchers that need to share a workstation with multiple GPUs. However, TensorFlow will use all the GPUs it can reach by default. Therefore, we need some settings about the allocation of computational resources.

First, by ``tf.config.list_physical_devices``, we can get a list of a particular type of computing device (e.g. ``GPU`` or ``CPU``) on the current machine. For example, running the following code on a workstation with four GPUs and one CPU.

.. code-block:: python

    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices(device_type='GPU')
    cpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices(device_type='CPU')
    print(gpus, cpus)

Output:

.. code-block:: python

    [PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU'), 
     PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:1', device_type='GPU'), 
     PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:2', device_type='GPU'), 
     PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:3', device_type='GPU')]     
    [PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:CPU:0', device_type='CPU')]

As can be seen, the workstation has four GPUs: ``GPU:0``, ``GPU:1``, ``GPU:2``, ``GPU:3`` and one CPU ``CPU:0``.

Then, by ``tf.config.set_visible_devices``, you can set the range of devices visible to the current program (the current program will only use its own visible devices, the invisible ones will not be used by the current program). For example, if in the above 4-GPU machine we need to restrict the current program to use only two graphics cards ``GPU:0`` and ``GPU:1``, we can use the following code.

.. code-block:: python

    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices(device_type='GPU')
    tf.config.set_visible_devices(devices=gpus[0:2], device_type='GPU')

.. admonition:: Tip

    You can also use the environment variable ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` to control the GPUs used by the current program. Suppose we have a 4-GPU machine is found with GPU 0,1 in use and GPU 2,3 idle. Input the following command in Linux shell::

        export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2,3

    Or add the following code

    .. code-block:: python

        import os
        os.environ['CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES'] = "2,3"

    can allocate GPU 2, 3 to the current program.

Setting GPU memory usage policy
------------------------------------------- 

By default, TensorFlow will use almost all available GPU memory to avoid the performance loss associated with memory fragmentation. However, TensorFlow offers two memory usage policies that give us more flexibility to control how our programs use GPU memory.

- Requiring GPU memory space only when needed (the program consumes very little GPU memory in initial, and requires it dynamically as the program runs).
- Limiting the consumption of of memory into a fixed size (the program will not exceed the limited memory size, an exception will be raised if it exceeds the limit).

You can set the GPU memory usage policy to "request memory space only when needed" by ``tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth``. The following code sets all GPUs to request memory space only when needed.

.. code-block:: python

    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices(device_type='GPU')
    for gpu in gpus:
        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(device=gpu, enable=True)

The following code use ``tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`` with a ``tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`` instance to set TensorFlow to consume a fixed size of 1GB GPU memory to ``GPU:0`` (which can also be regarded as creating a "virtual GPU" with 1GB of GPU memory).

.. code-block:: python

    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices(device_type='GPU')
    tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(
        gpus[0],
        [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=1024)])

.. admonition:: Hint

    in graph execution mode of TensorFlow 1.X API, you can also set TensorFlow's policy for using GPU memory by passing a ``tf.compat.v1.ConfigPhoto`` instance when you instantiate a new session. This is done by instantiating a ``tf.ConfigProto`` class, setting parameters, and specifying the ``config`` parameter when creating the ``tf.compat.v1.Session``. The following code sets TensorFlow to request memory space only when needed by the ``allow_growth`` option.

    .. code-block:: python

        config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
        config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
        sess = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)

    The following code sets TensorFlow to consume a fixed 40% proportion of the GPU memory with the ``per_process_gpu_memory_fraction`` option.

    .. code-block:: python

        config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
        config.gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = 0.4
        tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)

Simulating a multi-GPU environment with a single GPU
----------------------------------------------------

When our local development environment has only one GPU, but we need to write programs with multiple GPUs to perform training tasks on the workstation, TensorFlow provides us with a convenient feature that allows us to build multiple virtual GPUs in the local development environment, making debugging programs with multiple GPUs much easier. The following code builds two virtual GPUs, both with 2GB of memory, based on the physical GPU ``GPU:0``.

.. code-block:: python

    gpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration(
        gpus[0],
        [tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=2048),
         tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration(memory_limit=2048)])

We add the above code before the :ref:`multi-GPU training <en_multi_gpu>` code to allow code originally designed for multiple GPUs to run in a single GPU environment. When outputting the number of devices, the program will output.
